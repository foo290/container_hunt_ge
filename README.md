# 🚢 Container Hunt

**Container Hunt** is a 2D arcade-style game that I built using the **Godot Engine** coz, well... curiosity.

So basically you have to control a Maersk ship that rides over routes and navigates routes to **collect containers** while avoiding pirates.

Kinda like that nostalgic mario game.
